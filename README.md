Integrates RunKeeper with Google Calendar to track my gear usage.

When I used MapMyRun to track my running activities, I was able to associate running gear with each run. Therefore it was easy to determine how many miles I had covered in a pair of running shoes.

Following a migration to RunKeeper I lost this ability.

Using RK's public API and Google Calendar's public API this node.js module will keep track of my gear usage, and email me when I've reached a particular mileage in a single pair of shoes.
